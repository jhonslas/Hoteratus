				<div class="clearfix">&nbsp;</div>
				<h3>STORAGE OF COLLECTED INFORMATION</h3>
				<p ALIGN="justify">The security of your personal information is important to us.

When credit card details are collected, we simply pass them on in order to be processed as required. We never permanently store complete credit card details. </p>

				<h3>WHAT ARE COOKIES?</h3>
				<p ALIGN="justify">A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a website, that site's computer asks your computer for permission to store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically designated for cookies. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. Browsers are usually set to accept cookies. However, if you would prefer not to receive cookies, you may alter the configuration of your browser to refuse cookies. If you choose to have your browser refuse cookies, it is possible that some areas of our site will not function as effectively when viewed by the users. A cookie cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive or pass on computer viruses.</p>
				<div class="clearfix">&nbsp;</div>
				<h3>HOW DO WE USE INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM COOKIES?</h3>
				<p ALIGN="justify">As you visit and browse our website, the site uses cookies to differentiate you from other users. In some cases, we also use cookies to prevent you from having to log in more than is necessary for security. Cookies, in conjunction with our web server's log files, allow us to calculate the aggregate number of people visiting our website and which parts of the site are most popular. This helps us gather feedback to constantly improve our website and better serve our clients. Cookies do not allow us to gather any personal information about you and we do not intentionally store any personal information that your browser provided to us in your cookies.</p>

				<div class="clearfix">&nbsp;</div>
				<h3>IP ADDRESSES</h3>
				<p ALIGN="justify">IP addresses are used by your computer every time you are connected to the Internet. Your IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer. IP addresses are automatically collected by our web server as part of demographic and profile data known as traffic data so that data (such as the web pages you request) can be sent to you.</p>

				<div class="clearfix">&nbsp;</div>
				<h3>SHARING AND SELLING INFORMATION</h3>
				<p ALIGN="justify">We may share, sell, lend or lease any of the information that uniquely identify a subscriber (such as email addresses or personal details).</p>
